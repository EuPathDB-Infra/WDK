 * Actions, and it returns a stream of new Actions. The Actions it consumes are
 * those that have already been handled by the store. The Actions it produces
 * are handled by the Store as they are emitted (more on that later). Note that
 * it can return an empty stream, which might happen if an Action it expects is
 * never emitted.
 *
 * For convenience, Epics in WDK will also have configured services passed to
 * them.
 *
 * Epics are also scoped to a store. This means that an Epic will only receive
 * Actions for which WdkStore#storeShouldReceiveAction(channel) returns true,
 * and all Actions produced by the Epic will contain the Store's channel
 * (unless the `broadcast()` action decorator is used).

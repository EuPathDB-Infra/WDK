# WSF
The [WDK](https://github.com/VEuPathDB/WDK) Web Services Framework: web service architecture to support WDK searches that run a process rather than issue an RDBMS query.

Defines a [plugin API](Plugin/src/main/java/org/gusdb/wsf/plugin/Plugin.java) so that process-based searches can be plugged into the WDK search engine.

This repo will be retired soon, when the plugin functionality will be folded into the WDK directly.

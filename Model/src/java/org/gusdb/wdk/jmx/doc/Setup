Java Management Extensions for WDK

Requirements
    Tomcat 6.0.x
    Not tested with Tomcat 7
    Not compatible with Tomcat 5

Quick Start
-----------

In your web.xml add
  <listener>
    <listener-class>org.gusdb.wdk.jmx.JmxInitListener</listener-class>
  </listener>

The JmxInitListener loads the MBeans defined in
WEB-INF/classes/mbeanset.properties

You supply your own WEB-INF/classes/mbeanset.properties (just as you
supply your own struts-config.xml and web.xml). A mbeanset.properties file 
is included that references the WDK MBeans. You can install it as is in your 
WEB-INF/classes directory. If you write your own custom MBeans, add them
to your properties file.

mbeanset.properties format is "MBean class = MBean object name"
    org.gusdb.wdk.jmx.mbeans.UserDB=org.apidb.wdk:group=Databases,type=UserDB
    
Oracle's Java packages include a jconsole application that has a 
browser for MBeans. Of course you can access them through custom programs.
You will need to enable the JMX remote agent in your Tomcat's JVM if you want
to access the MBeans with external applications like jconsole. Refer to
documentation elsewhere for com.sun.management.jmxremote. Java 6 and later
may not require jmxremote if you only need local access. I have not used this.

Java Management Extensions for WDK

Requirements
    Tomcat 6.0.x
    Not tested with Tomcat 7
    Not compatible with Tomcat 5

Quick Start
-----------

In your web.xml add
  <listener>
    <listener-class>org.gusdb.wdk.jmx.JmxInitListener</listener-class>
  </listener>

The JmxInitListener loads the MBeans defined in
WEB-INF/classes/mbeanset.properties

You supply your own WEB-INF/classes/mbeanset.properties (just as you
supply your own struts-config.xml and web.xml). A mbeanset.properties file 
is included that references the WDK MBeans. You can install it as is in your 
WEB-INF/classes directory. If you write your own custom MBeans, add them
to your properties file.

mbeanset.properties format is "<mbean_class> = <mbean_object_name>"

For example: org.gusdb.wdk.jmx.mbeans.Cache = org.gusdb.wdk:type=Cache

Your mbean_class can be one of two types:

1. Any class you want to expose as an MBean.  WDK provides the abstract
   org.gusdb.wdk.jmx.mbeans.BeanBase class, which you can optionally subclass.
   It provides handles on the loaded WDK model and application servlet context.

2. An implementation of NamedMBeanFactory.  This allows you to dynamically build
   multiple instances of the same class and name them at runtime.  Typically,
   the mbean_object_name for a bean factory in mbeanset.properties will be
   parameterized.  It is up to the factory to decide what substitution will occur.

Oracle's Java packages include a jconsole application that has a 
browser for MBeans. Of course you can access them through custom programs.
You will need to enable the JMX remote agent in your Tomcat's JVM if you want
to access the MBeans with external applications like jconsole. Refer to
documentation elsewhere for com.sun.management.jmxremote. Java 6 and later
may not require jmxremote if you only need local access. I have not used this.

Oracle Database Permissions

The JMX MBean, `org.gusdb.wdk.jmx.mbeans.dbms` requires
  - `select from dba_data_files, dba_temp_files`
  - `UTL_INADDR` ACL, to run the query,
    - `select UTL_INADDR.get_host_name as server_name, UTL_INADDR.get_host_address as server_ip from dual;`

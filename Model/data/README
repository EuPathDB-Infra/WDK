The EuPathDB project now has a variety of apicomm/userDb setups.  These setups
can be created in an empty database with a set of SQL files.  Which files to
run and on which DBs depends on your Project.  In addition, if your DB is
replicated, you will have to run supplemental scripts to reset sequences on one
mirror to values that will not interfere with the other.  The following is a
listing of what scripts should be run against which DBs to recreate the proper
schema.

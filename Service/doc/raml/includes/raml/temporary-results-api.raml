displayName: Temporary Results

post:
  description: |
    This service provides the ability to store a combination of the specification
    for a search + a specification for a report (i.e. everything WDK needs to
    produce a reporter output data stream), to be accessed later via a produced ID.

    The POST creates and validates a temporary result specification and stores it
    in the answer request cache.  The submitted JSON must contain either a step ID
    or a search name+config, i.e.

         {
           stepId: integer,      // valid step ID for this user
           reportName: string,   // name of report
           reportConfig: object  // configuration of this report
         }

    OR

         {
           searchName: string,   // question name = url segment
           searchConfig: object, // standard answer spec object
           reportName: string,   // name of report
           reportConfig: object  // configuration of this report
         }

displayName: Record Types

get:
  description: >
    Get a listing of supported record types, either in summary or detail.
    
    Each Record Type describes one of the (potentially many) types of records that are available through the API .  Each Record Type includes a set of records of that type, and a set of searches that return different sets of those records.  The sets of records and searches are available in sub-endpoints.  Record types, and their records and searches, are the primary means of accessing data through this API.
    
    Individual records serve their data through "attributes," which are single-valued (e.g. "age") and "tables," which are multi-valued (e.g. "friends").

  queryParameters:
    expand: if false, just return an array of record type names (url segments).  If true return full details of each record type, as well as full details of all searches, and available reports.  This is the only endpoint that offers a full listing of  record types, searches and reports.
